//! Read back what the encoder writes, without a decoder.
//!
//! The real acceptance test for a lossless encoder is `decode(encode(x)) == x`
//! through somebody else's decoder, and that lives in `cargo xtask mlp`
//! because it needs one installed. This is what can be checked without one:
//! that the stream describes itself consistently — the lengths agree with the
//! bytes, the sync words are where the headers say they are, and every
//! checksum verifies.
//!
//! Which is worth having on its own. Every structural mistake made while
//! writing this encoder — a length counted in bytes where the format counts
//! words, a checksum over the wrong range — would have been caught here, and
//! caught with an error naming the field rather than "the decoder produced
//! silence".
