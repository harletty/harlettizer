    /// of them is a mix of the same elements. Stored as they are, the codec

    /// until FFmpeg's limit of eight matrices a substream under restart sync
    /// words A and B, which the 7.1's eight rows already fill, left them no
    /// room in channels 0 to 7. That cost folded streams five per cent.
    ///
    /// The reference pays nothing for it, because its channels are stored
    /// already decorrelated and the correction lives in rows it declares
    /// anyway. This does the same: a lifting step per channel, in the last
    /// substream's cascade, which has room, and the early substreams' rows
    /// rewritten over the decorrelated channels, at no extra rows.
    ///
    /// # How
    ///
    /// Channel `k`, from one up to the widest early presentation, is fitted by
    /// least squares over the interval to channels `0..k` as the cascade
    /// stores them, and a step `x[k] += Σ w·x[j]` goes in front of the cascade
    /// where the fit takes out more than [`DECORRELATION_BITS`]. A decoder
    /// runs these steps first and in rising `k`, each reading channels already
    /// restored; the encoder undoes them last and in falling `k`, each reading
    /// channels it has not touched yet — the same sums either way, so the
    /// round trip is exact.
    ///
    /// # Why one at a time
    ///
    /// A channel with its prediction taken out holds a small remainder, and
    /// the rows that rebuild a presentation from it then ask for coefficients
    /// far past the field's two: measured at 30 to 130, mostly in the 5.1, and
    /// the 7.1 has no spare row to scale one up with. Taken all at once, the
    /// steps left the rows writable in one interval in seven, for 0.5 % of the
    /// stream. So each step is kept only if every presentation can still be
    /// written after it, and the rest are skipped.
    ///
    /// What made most of them writable is a shift per presentation channel —
    /// see [`crate::hierarchy::rows_over_choosing_shifts`] — which says a row
    /// asking for a hundred at a hundred-and-twenty-eighth of its size. With a
    /// shift for every channel alike this came to 1.56 % of the programme
    /// slice; with one per channel, and held to the precision and the room
