//! Writing one access unit.
//!
//! An access unit is:
//!
//! ```text
//! ┌────────────────┬──────────────┬─────────────────┬──────────────┐
//! │ 4-byte header  │ major sync   │ substream       │ substream    │
//! │ length, parity │ (key units)  │ headers, 2 each │ payloads     │
//! └────────────────┴──────────────┴─────────────────┴──────────────┘
//! ```
//!
//! The header carries the total length and a parity nibble over itself and the
//! substream headers, and neither is known until the payload exists — so the
//! payload is written first and the header patched in afterwards.
//!
//! # Almost every field is optional
//!
//! A decoder keeps what it was last given, so a block that has nothing new to
//! say costs a bit rather than a description. What it may leave unsaid is
//! therefore a function of what the decoder is already holding, and that is
//! [`crate::model`]: the writer updates it as it emits, and the encoder asks
//! it whether a field has to be said at all. Being wrong about it does not
//! fail — it produces a stream that parses, whose every checksum verifies, and
//! which decodes to different samples — so the writer also asserts, in debug,
//! that every field it leaves unsaid is one the model says is already held.
