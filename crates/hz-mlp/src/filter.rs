//! The format's prediction filter, and choosing one.
//!
//! # The arithmetic is the contract
//!
//! A lossless predictor is only lossless if the encoder and the decoder make
//! *exactly* the same guess, so the guess cannot be made in floating point and
//! cannot be made in a different order. The decoder computes, per sample:
//!
//! ```text
//! accum    = Σ a[k]·signal[k] + Σ b[j]·residual[j]      (64-bit)
//! accum  >>= shift                                      (arithmetic)
//! sample   = accum + residual
//! ```
//!
//! and then pushes `sample` onto the signal history and `sample - accum` — the
//! residual — onto the residual history. This module does the same operations
//! in the same widths in the same order, and subtracts. [`lpc`](crate::lpc)
//! may use all the floating point it likes to *decide* the coefficients; once
//! they are integers, nothing here is approximate.
//!
//! # Two filters, one shift
//!
//! The `a` taps predict the next sample from past samples; the `b` taps
//! predict it from past prediction errors. Together they are an ARMA
//! predictor, and its error filter is `(1 − A)/(1 + B)`: the first filter
//! places zeroes, the second places poles. Poles are what let a sharp
//! resonance be cancelled by coefficients coarse enough to fit in the fields
//! the format provides — which is why a pure tone, which an eight-tap
//! all-zero filter handles badly, is what the second filter is for.
//!
//! Both use **the same shift**, and it is the first filter's: the decoder
//! reads a shift for each and uses only one. So the second filter's precision
//! is not its own to choose.
//!
//! **The second filter is a fixed design, not a fit.** Fitting `B` to the
//! residuals the first filter leaves finds nothing: after an eight-tap fit
//! what is left is the quantisation error of the coefficients, which is white,
//! and no model of past residuals predicts white noise. What `B` is good for
//! is a pair of poles that lifts the steep low-pass roll-off programme audio
//! has, which the first filter's zeros model badly — so [`SECOND_FILTERS`]
//! holds four designs, [`pick_second`] chooses between them once a restart
//! interval by coding in each of them the interval it is *about to meet*, and
//! the block fits its first filter to what the chosen one leaves. FFmpeg's
//! encoder does not use this filter at all.
//!
//! # The history crosses blocks, and stops at a restart
//!
//! Within a restart interval a decoder carries the last eight reconstructed
//! samples and the last four residuals across blocks and across access units,
//! whatever the orders were, and this encoder carries both for the same
//! reason. A **restart header wipes them**, along with the coefficients and
//! the orders — which is what makes a restart a point a decoder can join the
//! stream at, and would be pointless otherwise.
//!
//! That last sentence was wrong here for a while, and it cost a stream that
//! FFmpeg's decoder reconstructed exactly and `truehdd` did not: FFmpeg leaves
//! its state buffers alone across a restart, so an encoder that carried its
//! history over agreed with it and with nothing else. See
//! [`crate::encoder`].
